# ANN-bank-churn

Bank churn data refers to information about customers who have left or are likely to leave a bank. This data can include variables such as customer demographics, account information, transaction history, and customer feedback.

To predict whether a customer will stay or leave the bank, we can use an ANN, which is a type of machine learning model that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.
